# Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude) [Complete]
I commented as much as I can though unforutnately there is no bonus involved in this assignment and there is no "reactive" images that the assignment wanted originally (using Media calls). I genuinely could not figure that out. Everything else works fine no problem, even though it is not the fanciest of looks. I am no artist. For me, its fine that it works. - Mark
